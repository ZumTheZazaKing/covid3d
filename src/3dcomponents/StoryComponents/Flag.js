                This reminds me about my first victim. I don't quite remember it very well. <br/>
                I think it was around 17 November 2019. It was a 55 year old individual <br/>
                from Hubei province in China. I don't remember much about them, not <br/>
                even their gender. But those were the good times. It was easy to get <br/>
                around, from person to person because I was just a new fresh little virus <br/>
                that no one knew about.
                <br/><br/>
                Surprisingly, they noticed my presence around December 2019 at Wuhan, China.<br/>
                I was worried for a bit but man, humans are stupid. They suspected that I stemmed<br/>
                from something sold at a wet market in the city. Boy, they were wrong.
                <br/><br/>
                After some time, they figured out that I had no relation to the market at all.<br/>
                Some even started to think I originated in a bat, and I don't really know if<br/>
                it's wrong or not because I too don't know my origins.
                <br/><br/>
                Anyways, it was too late for them. I had already gone out of China as of March 2020<br/>
                and said "Hello" to the world!
